        <p style="font-size: 18px; margin-bottom: 20px;">After doing numerous user interviews and speaking with Dunzo's frequent customers, I discovered that, although being a fantastic application, Dunzo lacked a few features or flows that may contribute to higher customer retention. </p>
        <p style="font-size: 24px;margin-bottom: 20px;">SOLUTION</p>
        <p style="font-size: 18px;margin-bottom: 20px;">In this case study, I propose additional features such as a subscription model and a personalised shopping list, which may result in a smoother checkout process, better client retention, and loyalty.</p>

        <p style="font-size: 32px; margin-bottom: 20px;">Background</p>
        <p style="line-height: 30px;">
            Just to give you a bit of a background, Dunzo is a Bangalore-based hyper-local delivery service that connects users to the nearest delivery partner. The delivery and e-commerce company offers services that include delivery of packages, food, medicines, pet supplies, and more. It was co-founded in 2015 by Ankur Agarwal, Dulvir Suri, Kabir Biswas, and Mukund Jha.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 32px; font-style: italic; font-size: 20px;">“From any store to your door, just make a list and we’ll make it disappear. Just Dunzo it!”- Dunzo mission statement.</p>
    </div>

    <div style="margin-top: 80px; margin-bottom: 80px;">
        <p style="font-size: 32px; margin-bottom: 20px;">Goal</p>
        <ol>
            <li>To lead the lasting habits for users of the Dunzo app.</li>
            <li>To help them retain long-term loyalty.</li>
            <li>To increase the number of orders.</li>
            <li>To increase customer satisfaction.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div style="margin-top: 80px; margin-bottom: 80px;">
        <p style="font-size: 32px; margin-bottom: 20px;">My Proposal</p>
        <p>
            Instead of overhauling the existing Dunzo app, I decided to add subtle and useful features to the app called My Shopping List and Subscription Model. These features will help with the better usability of the app hence attracting more new customers and gaining the loyalty of existing customers. These features will help the user to achieve their goal quickly with fewer clicks.
        </p>

    <div style="margin-top: 80px; margin-bottom: 80px;">
        <p style="font-size: 26px; margin-bottom: 20px;">User Research</p>
        <p>
            The quantitative approach was used in conducting my UX research. This method aimed to gain measurable data that described user’s behavior and pattern, which can help me identify a certain phenomenon in the realms of Dunzo users that can drive the context of the research to a more specified manner.<br>

I started my user research with a survey of 6 open-ended questions. Surveys have been a valuable tool for gathering a large amount of Quantitative Data, so I took some time to craft my questions to reflect the information I needed at the beginning of my process.

        <p style="font-size: 26px; margin-bottom: 20px;">Scope</p>
        <p>
            <b>Users</b>: College students     , Working professionals      , Homebound <br>
            <b>Demographics:</b>  Age 20-50, Male and Female <br>

    <div style="margin-top: 80px; margin-bottom: 80px;">
        <p style="font-size: 26px; margin-bottom: 20px;">Findings and Insights</p>
        <p>Here are some statistics relevant to my project</p>
        <ol>
            <li>About 90% of respondents say they use Dunzo.</li>
            <li>90% said they use Dunzo on the daily basis to order daily essentials and sometimes for pick and drop of certain items.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div style="margin-top: 80px; margin-bottom: 80px;">
        <p style="font-size: 26px; margin-bottom: 20px;">Problems</p>
        <p>After analysing the feedback from the users, I found most of the time Dunzo app loses the love of the users, due to a myriad of reasons. Along with the competition and cost, the following factors are the reason for the difficulties.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Coverage (Users are unhappy about the location constraints within Bangalore)</li>
            <li>Lack of usage</li>
            <li>Complex checkout process</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div style="margin-top: 80px; margin-bottom: 80px;">
        <p style="font-size: 26px; margin-bottom: 20px;">What users have to say</p>
        <p style="font-style: italic;">“Catalog info is poor in the app.” </p>
        <p style="font-style: italic;">“Food delivery is just normal.” </p>
        <p style="font-style: italic;">“Too much effort in placing the order” </p>
        <p style="font-style: italic;">“User interface could be a lot simpler” </p>
        <p style="font-style: italic;">“Overall dunzo provides a good experience. Some slight improvements can make a big impact.” </p>
    </div>

    <div style="margin-top: 80px; margin-bottom: 80px;">
        <p style="font-size: 26px; margin-bottom: 20px;">Design Principles</p>
        <p>After my user research and user survey, I have come up with the set of design principles to admit while designing. I want to maintain direct relationship between the interview result and the UI design.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Seamless integration</b></li>
            <p>Each user has a unique schedule and habits. The experience could be seamlessly integrated into their daily activities without any complicated steps.</p>
            <li> <b>Simple</b></li>
            <p>The background of the app is simple to use. The user needs not learn new patterns</p>
            <li><b>Polite</b></li>
            <p>The design should be simple and useful enough for the users. There should not be a significant difference with the new features.</p>
        </ol>
        <p>After brainstorming and survey, I came up with two approaches which will help in solving two problems i.e. Lack of usage and complex checkout process which in turn increase the engagement and loyalty of the customers.</p>

            <li>80% of shoppers are more likely to buy from a company that offers personalized experiences. <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.epsilon.com/us/about-us/pressroom/new-epsilon-research-indicates-80-of-consumers-are-more-likely-to-make-a-purchase-when-brands-offer-personalized-experiences" target="_blank">(Epsilon)</a> </li>
            <li>44% of consumers say that they will likely become repeat buyers after a personalized shopping experience with a particular company. <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="http://grow.segment.com/Segment-2017-Personalization-Report.pdf" target="_blank">(Segment)</a></li>
            <li>77% of consumers have chosen, recommended, or paid more for a brand that provides a personalized service or experience. <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.forrester.com/analyst-bio/brendan-witcher/BIO7744" target="_blank">(Forrester)</a></li>
            <li>However, in another Forrester survey, 53% of digital experience delivery professionals said they lack the right technology to personalize experiences. </li>

    <div style="margin-top: 80px; margin-bottom: 80px;">
        <p style="font-size: 26px; margin-bottom: 20px;">1. Subscription Model</p>
        <p>Especially after worldwide lockdown consumers have become accustomed to convenience as an experience. They expect to be able to access movies, TV, and music on demand. Many consumers want transportation, whether it’s a car or bicycle, to be available as-needed, without onerous upfront costs.
            Many consumers want clothing and groceries delivered to their home regularly, and customized to their specifications.
            Many companies across industries are propelling their businesses forward by automating administrative processes, broadening access to services, and placing the power in the hands of the subscriber to choose and self-manage subscriptions.<br><br>
            
            According to Zuora-  a SaaS company and the worlds foremost evangelist of the Subscription Economy report, In 2020, companies offering subscription business services were able to demonstrate value to their customers by providing always-on support. These businesses outpaced sales growth of the S&P Commercial and Professional Services sector by nearly 1.5x. In 2020, the revenue of Business Services
            companies in the SEI grew at a rate of 7% compared to S&P 500 Commercial &
            Professional Services Sales Growth rate of 4.7%.

            <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;"><img src="../assets/6.png" width="802" height="458"></div>
            <p><b>Advantages of subcription model for the business</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Increased return on customer acquisition costs</b></li>
                <p>For subscription services, your customers’ repeat business is implied at the time of purchase.    Providing you keep your subscribers happy, this type of model ensures a consistent source of recurring revenue from repeat customers.<br>

                    The longer a subscriber stays loyal to your brand, the higher your retention rates and the greater their customer lifetime value (CLTV). This means you’re getting much better value for money when it comes to acquisition spends, which is great news for your profit margins.</p>
                <li><b> Better financial forecasting</b></li>
                <p>A huge benefit of a subscription-based business model is that you can accurately and reliably predict your business’ revenue stream. You should be able to go into each month which a clear idea of how much profit you can expect, whereas regular ecommerce retailers can face huge monthly and seasonal fluctuations. </p>
                <li><b>Better inventory management</b></li>
                <p>As a subscription retailer, you know how many subscribers you have and how much stock you need. There’s less risk of unpredictable demand on your fulfilment. As a result, you can anticipate demand and supply with confidence, helping to make your business processes much more consistent.</p>
                <li><b>Opportunities for better relationships with customers</b></li>
                <p>Subscription ecommerce opens up opportunities to engage with customers on a regular basis across a range of channels. This is a valuable opportunity for merchants to build rich conversational relationships with customers.<br>

                    Subscription retailers can use the comprehensive understanding they have of their customers’ preferences and usage behaviours to serve personalised content. Merchants can tailor messaging, recommendations and ads to each individual subscriber, providing a personal, memorable experience that fosters loyalty and engagement.</p>
                </ul>

                <p><b>Benefits of subscriptions for your customers</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Convenience</b></li>
                <p>For customers, subscriptions represent the ultimate in convenience. Subscribers receive something they need or want on a regular basis, direct to their door – it just turns up without having to place repeat orders. This is perfect for the modern, time-poor consumer. </p>
                <li> <b>Personalised experience</b></li>
                <p>Increasingly, shoppers are demanding personalised ecommerce experiences tailored to their individual needs. In fact, 63% of consumers expect personalisation as standard now.<br>

                    As we mentioned earlier, subscription ecommerce can help satiate this compelling desire that consumers have for personalisation. In particular, curation-based subscriptions enable merchants to deliver an intricately tailored customer experience. When a customer receives their monthly box of goodies that has been curated with their personal tastes and needs in mind, they feel understood, valued and connected.</p>
                <li><b>Assists with budgeting</b></li>
                <p>A subscription also allows for easy budgeting. Having a set amount of money taken at regular intervals helps consumers stick to their monthly budget and monitor their outgoings more efficiently.<br>

                    Plus, ‘Subscribe & Save’ options enable consumers to save money – a very popular benefit!</p>
                </ul>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Contextual limitations</b></li>
            <p>I went through many learning curves during my time finishing this project. One of the things that helped me most in delivering which I believe to be a suitable solution is setting realistic goals of what is necessary and what is redundant based on the context. This pushed me to evaluate my expectations in creating an experience that allows for all of the factors to be present and still consider it “worthwhile”. I believe that setting realistic expectations helps us grow and become more flexible.</p>
            <li> <b>Always look both ways</b></li>
            <p>There is a saying where we need to look at each side of the road before crossing the street, I believe that this applies deeply to the design process. When making a product, there are multiple parties involved, and when there are multiple parties involved, multiple needs emerge on the table, and those needs should be met. Working on this project helped me understand the overall meaning of empathizing in the realms of UI/UX Design. Where we designers need not only to think from the perspective of the users but understanding the business side is as crucial in delivering the optimal solution.</p>
            <li><b>What can I do better?</b></li>
            <ol>
                <li>Research the features and results of competitors.</li>
                <li>Select participants from different areas.</li>
                <li>Usability test of the prototype with users.</li>
                <li>Design direction.</b></li>
            </ol>
            <li><b>Learnings</b></li>
            <p>This project gives me an understanding that how difficult it is to introduce a small new feature into a reputed company. The touchpoints we need to consider before changing a small button on a screen.</p>
        </ul>
